# Hello Godot IoT and Pins

> I’m really going to learn Godot on my Raspberry Pi—and not even bother with the IoT stuff or the pins on the device, haha. No.

In Belgium, we have schools that teach about electromechanics and IoT for people who want to work in the industry.
I’m not in the industry, but I do know how to configure Arduino, wire up buttons, and build some nice IoT projects thanks to hackathons and working with game developement clients.

**What is the purpose of this repository?**

To create a set of skill steps for young adults who want to start experimenting with microcontrollers and electricity during hackathons or short 1–3 week workshops. As I am going to teach Godot for 10+ years, linked partialy to Godot.

IoT is not my main focus. Don’t expect me to be a reference point or ready to train people for the industry after my workshops ;) .
All I can do is teach the basics while re-learning them myself.

This repository will be an introduction to electricity with Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and ESP32—just enough to get people started during a hackathon or a three-week introduction in a school or training center.

> Warning: Mastering the magic of electricity can take years.
> ElectroBOOM is a professional at it—and even he is still discovering the strange ways electricity behaves in his videos:

> As for me, I’m just a game developer who knows how to make LEDs blink and read buttons via UART Bluetooth… 😉


**Hackathon here**: You started a hackathon and you want to pratice.   
Ping me the issue with what you need to learn: [Issues](https://github.com/EloiStree/HelloGodotIotAndPins/issues)  

**Initial creation of this repository:**  
We asked me to teach at [https://www.ifapme.be/](https://www.ifapme.be/).  
I had in mind hundreds of small topics linked to IoT that I would love to teach.     
But it takes time to create workshops, and I never took the time to have cheatsheets on the main topics.    
This repository is here for me to pin down basic knowledge paths to teach and create RTFM on those points in 2026.      


**Homework:** If you are here, you want to learn how to use electricity. So subscribe to ElectoBOOM and give him a like on all his video through the year.

If you are French and want to learn a bit about High Voltage electricity.
So the same for this channel:
